        <p>
          I spend my time writing code and making art. I'm passionate about projects that engage public space and
          encourage introspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently apprenticing as a front-end engineer at Taulia, in San Francisco. In 2012, I received a Bachelor of Arts in Art from Reed
          College, Portland, OR.

          "Outsider does have a nice little paradox embedded in it:
          for an artist to be considered an outsider, he or she must
          first be brought inside the professional art world by an
          insider. In other words, everyone the art world considers an
          outsider is de facto an insider. The standard outsider
          biography thus includes not only a traumatic (typically
          motherless) childhood, a history of institutionalization
          (orphanage, asylum, prison), a stunted education, a
          subsistence job, and an intense drive to make art, but also
          a discovery story, a tale of someone with cultural
          connections who brings the outsider in."

          "As governments release more open data and contribute to

          data, decisions can be based on what we know, instead of what
          we think. This can only lead to better policy and
          governance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we use technology and data to develop these systems and models of
          the future, we must be cautious to avoid the "creepy
          factor." A clear and proven way to do this is through open
          and standards-based releases of data. We are seeing more
          and more administrations passing laws or orders to mandate
          the publishing of certain data—from Philadelphia to
          Chicago. A path in which the expansion of these networks
          walks hand in hand with transparency is one on which we can
          advance, with accountability."

          "Backbone.js does not copy model attributes; it simply
          returns whatever you’re asking for. So, as you might guess,
          if you ask for an object, you will get a reference to that
          object, and any manipulation to the object will directly
          manipulate the actual object in the model."

        <p>
          "..if you’re writing in Backbone.js, you should be following test-driven
          development (TDD) for your models and collections. I follow TDD by
          first writing failing Jasmine.js unit tests against my models or
          collections. Once the unit tests are written and failing, I flush out
          the model or collection."
